        <p>Your provider wants to promote itself as a specialised aged care provider.</p>
        <p>Older Australians are a diverse group of people with a wide range of care needs. While all aged care providers must be respectful and responsive to the background and life experiences of the people they support, some aged care providers go beyond this and 'specialise' in caring for one or more groups that have special aged care needs.</p>
        <p>People can search for providers with these specialisations by using the 'Find a provider' tool on the My Aged Care website.</p>

        <div class="slds-box slds-box_border slds-m-vertical_medium slds-p-around_small">
            <p>Your feedback will be private, and you can choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym.</p>
            <p>Your personal information is protected by law, including the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles, and is being collected by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care for the primary purpose of verifying the eligibility of aged care providers against the criteria set out in the Specialisation Verification Framework to ensure that aged care provider profiles on My Aged Care reflect information, which is accurate and relevant, for the purposes of providing aged care recipients and their representatives with specialised healthcare services.

            <h2 class="slds-text-heading_medium">Can you share some feedback with us?</h2>
            <p>Your aged care provider has submitted an application to nominate itself as a specialised aged care provider for Veterans.</p>

            <p>If you belong to this group, the Department of Health and Aged Care (the department) invites you to share with us your experienced of receiving this specialised care from your provider.</p>
