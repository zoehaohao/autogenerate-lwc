        <p>Your provider wants to promote itself as a specialised aged care provider.</p>
        <p>Older Australians are a diverse group of people with a wide range of care needs. While all aged care providers must be respectful and responsive to the background and life experiences of the people they support, some aged care providers go beyond this and 'specialise' in caring for one or more groups that have special aged care needs.</p>
        <p>People can search for providers with these specialisations by using the 'Find a provider' tool on the My Aged Care website.</p>

        <div class="slds-box slds-box_x-small slds-m-vertical_medium slds-text-body_small">
            <p>Your feedback will be private, and you can choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym.</p>
